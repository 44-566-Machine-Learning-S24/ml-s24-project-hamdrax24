# Raw Data

The database used in this projct is [Rain in Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).

As the initial dataset is too large to upload unto github, a smaller, cutdown version using only the features to be tested and randomly shuffled from the full sized database was used.

The notebook used to edit the database can be found [here](Notebooks/data_processing.ipynb).
The cutdown version of the database can be fond [here](DataSets/weatherAUSProcessed.csv)
