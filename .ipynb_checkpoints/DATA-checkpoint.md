# DATA
The data exploration can be found in [this](Notebooks/initial_exploration.ipynb). Here I looked over the possible reationship between the featires and the target. There was nothing I could get by looking at this relation as the boolean nature of the target made all the data clump together in one area.

However, looking at a the relationships between the features showed strong signs of correlation. More information can be found in the notebook.
