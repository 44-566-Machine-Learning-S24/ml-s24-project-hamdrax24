# 44-566 machine-learning project
The goal of this project was to be able to simply predict whether or not it would rain based on current weather data (up to a day).

Initially, this project made use of government metrological database to get information on the weather in the missouri state area. However, the database did not give any exact information on whether it rain in a 24/hr period so it had to be dropped.

The new database I got from kaggle has all the information we need to perform my ML training so I went with that instead.

I had expected to finish this project with various models which would help be able to predict whether it would rain based on the information given. What I did not expect was to create a model which could predict whether it would rain or not even when tested against the test set and with cross-validation.
