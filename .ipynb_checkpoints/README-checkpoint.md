# 44-566 machine-learning project
The database 3618222 is an hourly report of various weather features of the year 2010 in the state of missouri.

The notebook initial_exploration explores the database being used. The features were explores to see if any obvious relation exist to decide which to use for linear regresion. Average wind speed and dewpoint average where my first two choices. The note linear_regression is me attemptint to make a model using linear regression and so far I discovered that average wind speed and dewpoint average were not enough to make a good model both individually or together so I included Average temprature which produced a much better score; But not good enough to use as an actual model.
